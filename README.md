## About Me
### *My Name*
I am **Mason Parker**

### *What I hope to learn*
I hope to learn more about **Git** and **Github** and make it easier to work with

### *Interesting fact*
- I actually have forked **Unreal Engine** and built it from source so I can add my own features.
* Currently I added **branching** to the material compiler to save on GPU instructions.
+ I plan on adding **SMAA** because I think it looks better than TAA.
